# RoomCReconstruction

RoomCReconstruction is currently able to cluster connected flat areas of a point cloud.<br>
The following is planned in the future:

 - ignore clusters within the pointcloud, s.t. only the "surface" (i.e. walls of a room) are processed further
 - Transform the point-cloud-walls into clear planes
